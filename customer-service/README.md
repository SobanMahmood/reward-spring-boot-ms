## Customer Service
This project is responsible for handling customer data. It has its own database, and its script is placed in the root directory which can be run to setup and populate database with dummy data.

Currently we are using following end-points as per requirement.
[localhost:9003/api/v1/customers](localhost:9003/api/v1/customers)
<br/>This retrieves all customers list.
